# Virtual Desktop Manager for Windows

A personal AutoHotkey solution for managing Windows virtual desktops that I built to solve my own needs. Feel free to fork it and modify it to suit your requirements!

## üîç What Is This?

This is an AutoHotkey script that helps organize windows across virtual desktops by:
- Moving specific windows to designated desktops
- Pinning applications to appear on all desktops
- Auto-applying rules as new windows appear

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. Install [AutoHotkey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or later
2. Clone/download this repository
3. Copy `desktop_mappings.ini.example` to `desktop_mappings.ini`
4. Copy `pinned_windows.txt.example` to `pinned_windows.txt`
5. Run `VirtualDesktopManager.ahk`
6. Configure your rules in the GUI

## üìù Configuration Examples
